My Gradius Mod is really just a fun mod in implementing Gradius features into Terraria.

Current features:
1. Options/Multiples
  - These are powerful drones in the Gradius series, and Gradius is well-known for this feature.
  - Deploy one, and the Option drone will copy some of your projectiles.
  - It is an accessory. No ingredients required to craft.

The mod is quite young, so the mod will focus in implementing features rather than balance, for now. Join my Discord Server if you have any suggestions and bug reports.
