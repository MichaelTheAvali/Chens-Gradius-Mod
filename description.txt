My Gradius Mod is really just a fun mod in implementing Gradius features into Terraria.

Current features:
1. Options/Multiples
  - These are powerful drones in the Gradius series, and Gradius is well-known for this feature.
  - Deploy one, and the Option drone will copy any of your projectiles.
  - It is an accessory. No recipes yet. Only accessible through Hero's Mod or Cheat Sheet.

The mod is quite young, so the mod will focus in implementing features rather than balance, for now. Join my Discord Server if you have any suggestions.
