My Gradius Mod is really just a fun mod in implementing Gradius features into Terraria.

Current features:
1. Options/Multiples
  - These are powerful drones in the Gradius series, and Gradius is well-known for this feature.
  - Deploy one, and the Option drone will copy some of your projectiles.
  - It is an accessory in the game, for now.
2. Force
  - This is yet another drone from the R-Type series.
  - It has its own set of attacks, and you can control it like in the original game.
  - Its power is based from the held weapon's stats.
  - Set a keybind in Force Action to control it.
  - For now, it is an accessory to make it accessible.
3. Freeze Options
  - An upgrade from the normal Options, and it is a new feature that came with Gradius V.
  - Functions the same as the normal one, except it has an added action.
  - Hold The Option Action hotkey, and these options will behave differently.
  - Allow your options to be more controllable.
4. Rotate Options
  - Also an upgrade from normal Options, and it is a feature in Gradius III.
  - Implementation is inspired from Gradius V.
  - Hold The Option Action hotkey, and these options will revolve around the owner.
  - Switchable rotation directions by toggling the hotkey again.

The mod is quite young, so the mod will focus in implementing features rather than balance, for now. Join my Discord Server if you have any suggestions and bug reports.
