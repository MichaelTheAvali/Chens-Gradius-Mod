My Gradius Mod is really just a fun mod in implementing Gradius features into Terraria.

Current features:
1. Options/Multiples
2. Force
3. Freeze Options
4. Rotate Options
5. Needle Force
6. Option Seed
7. Charge Multiple

For more information about these features, visit the homepage.

New Enemies:
1. Moai
2. Garun
3. Zalk
4. Grazia
5. Big Core Custom

These enemies will only spawn in Hard mode.
All enemies in this mod also display a behavior of retaliation as common in the Gradius series if the world is in Expert mode.
For more information about these enemies and the behaviors, visit the homepage.

Added Music with music box:
1. The Position Light (Gradius ReBirth version, originally from Nemesis 3)
2. Departure For Space (Gradius III From Myth to Legend version)
3. Tabidachi (Gradius II Gofer no Yabou Version)

Added Music without music boxes yet:
1. Aircraft Carrier (Gradius Slot version, only played during Big Core Custom fight)

The mod is quite young, so the mod will focus in implementing features rather than balance, for now. Contact us if you have any suggestions and bug reports.
