My Gradius Mod is really just a fun mod in implementing Gradius features into Terraria.

Current features:
1. Options/Multiples
  - These are powerful drones in the Gradius series, and Gradius is well-known for this feature.
  - Deploy one, and the Option drone will copy some of your projectiles.
  - It is an accessory in the game, for now.
2. Force
  - This is yet another drone from the R-Type series.
  - It has its own set of attacks, and you can control it like in the original game.
  - Its power is based from the held weapon's stats.
  - Set a keybind in Force Action to control it.
  - For now, it is an accessory to make it accessible.
3. Freeze Options
  - An upgrade from the normal Options, and it is a new feature that came with Gradius V.
  - Functions the same as the normal one, except it has an added action.
  - Hold The Option Action hotkey, and these options will behave differently.
  - Allow your options to be more controllable.
4. Rotate Options
  - Also an upgrade from normal Options, and it is a feature in Gradius III.
  - Implementation is inspired from Gradius V.
  - Hold The Option Action hotkey, and these options will revolve around the owner.
  - Switchable rotation directions by toggling the hotkey again.
5. Needle Force
  - Functions the same as the Standard Force, except with different attack pattern.
  - Attach and detach just like the Standard Force,
  - This Force sprays a lot of bullets when detached.

New Enemies:
1. Moai
  - These eastern head statues are recurring enemies within the Gradius series.
  - Their weakness is the mouth.
  - When their mouth is open, attack it! Be careful that they release moai bubbles as they open their mouths.
  - Any projectiles can damage Moai Bubbles, but be warned that swung melee weapons cannot destroy the bubbles.
  - Any weapon can damage the Moai given the Moai is hit in the open mouth.
  - They spawn in the desert and the temple.
2. Garun
  - For reference: https://gradius.fandom.com/wiki/Garun
  - These Bacterion ships are known to travel fast, and will fire bullets towards you when you're behind them.
  - They are famous for their sine wave movement pattern.
  - They will spawn anywhere in the surface and space.
3. Zalk
  - For reference: https://gradius.fandom.com/wiki/Fan
  - These Bacterion vessels fly in groups in a series.
  - They are called Zalk in Gradius II, but their implemented pattern is based from the first Gradius game.
  - Destroy them quickly before they spray bullets when they start intercepting your position.
  - They will spawn anywhere in the surface and space.

Added Music:
1. The Position Light (Gradius ReBirth version, originally from Nemesis 3)

Added music will only be in the form of a music box, for now.

The mod is quite young, so the mod will focus in implementing features rather than balance, for now. Join my Discord Server if you have any suggestions and bug reports.
