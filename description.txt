My Gradius Mod is really just a fun mod in implementing Gradius features into Terraria.

Current features:
1. Options/Multiples
  - These are powerful drones in the Gradius series, and Gradius is well-known for this feature.
  - Deploy one, and the Option drone will copy any of your projectiles.
  - It is an accessory. No recipes yet.

The mod is quite young, so the mod will focus in implementing features rather than balance, for now. Join my Discord Server if you have any suggestions.
