Hello. I decided to share my mod here in the forums. I'm not very good at documenting, but it will improve as time passes. Without further ado...

[ATTACH type="full" alt="ChensGradiusModBannerCropped.png"]228045[/ATTACH]
[B][U][SIZE=6]Mod Version: 0.7.1
tModLoader: 0.11.5[/SIZE][/U][/B]

I have always been a fan of the classic side-scrollers, so I made a mod related to it. On top of that, I want to learn C# as well. It is still a small mod, so content is not abundant.
This mod's content will focus in implementing features that came from classic side-scrollers such as Gradius, R-Type and more.
The mod will also focus to be [B][U]playable on multiplayer[/U][/B], so please file in a bug if there is a desync issue that is detected.

This mod is on the Mod Browser, so download it from there.
If the Mod Browser is down, then you can refer to this link to download the latest release: [URL='https://github.com/cheeeeeeeeeen/Chens-Gradius-Mod/releases']Gradius Mod Releases[/URL]

[B]Contents[/B]
[LIST=1]
[*]Options/Multiples
[LIST]
[*]These are powerful drones in the Gradius series, and Gradius is well-known for this feature.
[*]Deploy one, and the Option drone will copy some of your projectiles.
[*]It is an accessory in the game, for now.
[*]The accessories can be combined.
[*][SPOILER="Movement Showcase"][ATTACH type="full" width="283px" alt="Normal_Option_Movement_v2.gif"]227873[/ATTACH]
It follows your movement pathing!
[/SPOILER]

[/SPOILER]
[/LIST]
[*]Force
[LIST]
[*]This is yet another drone from the R-Type series.
[*]It has its own set of attacks, and you can control it like in the original game.
[*]Its power is based from the held weapon's stats.
[*]Set a keybind in Force Action to control it.
[*]For now, it is an accessory to make it accessible.
[/LIST]
[*]Freeze Options
[LIST]
[*]An upgrade from the normal Options, and it is a new feature that came with Gradius V.
[*]Functions the same as the normal one, except it has an added action.
[*]Hold The Option Action hotkey, and these options will behave differently.
[*]Allow your options to be more controllable.
[*][SPOILER="Freeze Showcase"][ATTACH type="full" width="240px" alt="Freeze_Option.gif"]227876[/ATTACH]
While hotkey is held down, their positions are paused even if you're moving!
[/SPOILER]
[/LIST]
[*]Rotate Options
[LIST]
[*]Also an upgrade from normal Options, and it is a feature in Gradius III.
[*]Implementation is inspired from Gradius V.
[*]Hold The Option Action hotkey, and these options will revolve around the owner.
[*]Switchable rotation directions by toggling the hotkey again.
[*][SPOILER="Rotate Showcase"][ATTACH type="full" width="271px" alt="Rotate_Option.gif"]227877[/ATTACH]
Hold hotkey to let them revolve around you! Rotation direction can be toggled by pressing the hotkey again.
[/SPOILER]
[/LIST]
[*]Needle Force
[LIST]
[*]Functions the same as the Standard Force, except with different attack pattern.
[*]Attach and detach just like the Standard Force,
[*]This Force sprays a lot of bullets when detached.
[/LIST]
[/LIST]
[B]New Enemies[/B]
[LIST=1]
[*]Moai
[LIST]
[*]These eastern head statues are recurring enemyes within the Gradius series.
[*]Their weakness is the mouth.
[*]When their mouth is open, attack it! Be careful that they release moai bubbles as they open their mouths.
[*]Any projectiles can damage Moai Bubbles, but be warned that swung melee weapons cannot destroy the bubbles.
[*]Any weapon can damage the Moai given the Moai is hit in the open mouth.
[*]They spawn in the desert and the temple.
[/LIST]
[*]Garun
[LIST]
[*]For reference: [URL='https://gradius.fandom.com/wiki/Garun']Garun[/URL]
[*]These Bacterion ships are known to travel fast, and will fire bullets towards you when you're behind them.
[*]They are famous for their sine wave movement pattern.
[*]They will spawn anywhere in the surface and space.
[/LIST]
[*]Zalk
[LIST]
[*]For reference: [URL='https://gradius.fandom.com/wiki/Fan']Fan[/URL]
[*]These Bacterion vessels fly in groups in a series.
[*]They are called Zalk in Gradius II, but their implemented pattern is based from the first Gradius game.
[*]Destroy them quickly before they spray bullets when they start intercepting your position.
[*]They will spawn anywhere in the surface and space.
[/LIST]
[*]Grazia
[LIST]
[*]For reference: [URL='https://gradius.fandom.com/wiki/Dee-01']Dee-01[/URL]
[*]These are Bacterion turrets stationed on the ground.
[*]They are common in the Gradius series.
[*]They can be deployed on world floor or ceiling.
[*]They will spawn anywhere near the surface and underground.
[/LIST]
[/LIST]
[B]Added Music[/B]
All music will be in the form of a music box for now...
[LIST=1]
[*]The Position Light (Gradius ReBirth version, originally from Nemesis 3)
[*]Departure For Space (Gradius III From Myth to Legend version)
[/LIST]

If you are curious about what our current plans are, you can look them up on the project board.

[I][U]Highlighted Issue[/U][/I]
The Options do copy even modded projectiles from other mods, which is great. This comes with a cost, however. Due to mod creator's unique way of coding projectile code, the options may not behave properly, [U]and may duplicate and copy generated projectiles created by another friendly projectile[/U].
If you know a mod's projectile that does this, and you do not want this overpowered behavior, simply contact us about it! Check the [I]Contact Us[/I] section below, or you may simply comment here:
