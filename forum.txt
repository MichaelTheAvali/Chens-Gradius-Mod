Hello. I decided to share my mod here in the forums. I'm not very good at documenting, but it will improve as time passes. Without further ado...

[ATTACH type="full" alt="ChensGradiusModBannerCropped.png"]228045[/ATTACH]
[B][U][SIZE=6]Mod Version: 0.8.3
tModLoader: 0.11.5[/SIZE][/U][/B]

I have always been a fan of the classic side-scrollers, so I made a mod related to it. On top of that, I want to learn C# as well. It is still a small mod, so content is not abundant.
This mod's content will focus in implementing features that came from classic side-scrollers such as Gradius, R-Type and more.
The mod will also focus to be [B][U]playable on multiplayer[/U][/B], so please file in a bug if there is a desync issue that is detected.

This mod is on the Mod Browser, so download it from there.
If the Mod Browser is down, then you can refer to this link to download the latest release: [URL='https://github.com/cheeeeeeeeeen/Chens-Gradius-Mod/releases']Gradius Mod Releases[/URL]

If you want to help making sprites for this mod, then you are welcome to join us. Check the Discord Link below in [I]Contact Us [/I]section.

[B]New Enemies[/B]
[LIST=1]
[*]Moai
[LIST]
[*]These eastern head statues are recurring enemyes within the Gradius series.
[*]Their weakness is the mouth.
[*]When their mouth is open, attack it! Be careful that they release moai bubbles as they open their mouths.
[*]Any projectiles can damage Moai Bubbles, but be warned that swung melee weapons cannot destroy the bubbles.
[*]Any weapon can damage the Moai given the Moai is hit in the open mouth.
[*]They spawn in the desert and the temple.
[/LIST]
[*]Garun
[LIST]
[*]For reference: [URL='https://gradius.fandom.com/wiki/Garun']Garun[/URL]
[*]These Bacterion ships are known to travel fast, and will fire bullets towards you when you're behind them.
[*]They are famous for their sine wave movement pattern.
[*]They will spawn anywhere in the surface and space.
[/LIST]
[*]Zalk
[LIST]
[*]For reference: [URL='https://gradius.fandom.com/wiki/Fan']Fan[/URL]
[*]These Bacterion vessels fly in groups in a series.
[*]They are called Zalk in Gradius II, but their implemented pattern is based from the first Gradius game.
[*]Destroy them quickly before they spray bullets when they start intercepting your position.
[*]They will spawn anywhere in the surface and space.
[/LIST]
[*]Grazia
[LIST]
[*]For reference: [URL='https://gradius.fandom.com/wiki/Dee-01']Dee-01[/URL]
[*]These are Bacterion turrets stationed on the ground.
[*]They are common in the Gradius series.
[*]They can be deployed on world floor or ceiling.
[*]They will spawn anywhere near the surface and underground.
[/LIST]
[*]Big Core Custom
[LIST]
[*]Famous recurring boss from the whole series of Gradius.
[*]They are known for the 4 front laser cannons shooting towards their opponent.
[*]They are also known for their simple vertical movement.
[*]It has a Custom on its name due to it still being an incomplete implementation.
[*]It will spawn by a random chance in Space after Golem is defeated.
[/LIST]
[*]Sagna
[LIST]
[*]For reference: [URL='https://gradius.fandom.com/wiki/Jumper']Jumper[/URL]
[*]They are known for their notorious bullet spread pattern.
[*]They have an upside-down version, in which they have reversed gravity.
[*]They can be found in the first Gradius game, but the behavior is inspired from Gradius III.
[*]It will spawn by a random chance in surface and underground caverns.
[/LIST]
[/LIST]

These enemies will only [B]spawn in Hard mode[/B].

All enemies in this mod also display a behavior of retaliation as common in the Gradius series if the world is in Expert mode.
Retaliation behavior is an enemy trait where the enemy shoots hostile bullets upon taking damage. Currently, there are three kinds of behaviors implemented: Spray, Spread and Explode.
Spray pattern is a single inaccurate bullet spawned towards the player. They are often faster than the normal attacks of the enemies.
Spread pattern is a group of bullets fired in a single shot. All of the bullets have the same speed, only their directions differ.
Explode pattern is a group of bullets fired in all directions in a single shot. There is room for evasion here compared to Spread pattern, and are often slower.


[B]Added Music with music box[/B]
[LIST=1]
[*]The Position Light (Gradius ReBirth version, originally from Nemesis 3)
[*]Departure For Space (Gradius III From Myth to Legend version)
[*]Tabidachi (Gradius II Gofer no Yabou Version)
[/LIST]
[B]Added Music without music box[/B]
[LIST=1]
[*]Aircraft Carrier (Gradius Slot version, only played during Big Core Custom fight)
[/LIST]

[I][U]Highlighted Issue[/U][/I]
The Options do copy even modded projectiles from other mods, which is great. This comes with a cost, however. Due to mod creator's unique way of coding projectile code, the options may not behave properly, [U]and may duplicate and copy generated projectiles created by another friendly projectile[/U].
If you know a mod's projectile that does this, and you do not want this overpowered behavior, simply contact us about it! Check the [I]Contact Us[/I] section below, or you may simply comment here:
